# my-first-contribution

Learn how to create pull requests and make your first open-source contribution step by step!

## How does it work?

Follow these steps to make your first contribution:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch.
4. Add your GitHub username and a link to your GitHub profile at the end of the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file.
5. Push the changes to your forked repository.
6. Create a pull request targeting the _main_ branch of this repository. Don't worry, this repository is a safe place to make your first pull request. You can't break anything here or bother any maintainers.

You won't be judged here. We all start somewhere!

## Rules

There are two subtleties in this project that you need to find to get your pull request accepted.
If you find them, you'll be able to successfully add your GitHub username to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file.
If not, your PR will be closed, but you're welcome to try again â™¡
